		Much better parsing of VPM-CPL and VPM-XML files.

			data.

			others).
		Better unit testing.

		Added more author-only tests.

0.94	10-10-2010
		Refactored into BlueCoat::SGOS

0.95	11-11-2011
		Removed support and tests for SGOS 4.x.
		Added a new get_sysinfo_from_data method to parse sysinfo that
			already exists in a data structure.
		Added an internal-only function to parse the last hardware
			and software reboot times.
		Parsing of the uptime is now also returned in seconds since
			the epoch.

1.00	02-28-2012
		Updated methods to capture sysinfo data.  It is no longer necessary
			to connect to the Blue Coat ProxySG to retrieve the realm name to
			pass back to the LWP::UserAgent constructor.  Instead, the username
			and password are passed directly to the initial connection to the
			device.  This saves a round trip to the device.
		Added a new method to send commands to the ProxySG.  It is name
			send_command and takes a scalar containing commands to be run
			on the ProxySG.
		Updated the module to no longer automatically parse the sysinfo file.
			This is necessary if you only want the sysinfo file.
		Added a capture.pl example script to the examples directory.  This script
			takes the sysinfo from a remote device and saves in on the local
			filesystem with a timestamp.
		Updated copyright.

1.01	07-09-2012 1922
		Added the ability to use Build.PL to install the distribution, to be
		    more friendly for non-Unix systems.
		Updated copyright to be GPL v2 only.
		Testing is now more aggressive.
